# Password Generator

## Description
- I wanted to create the ablity to choose what you wanted in a password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.)and for it to generate a random password at however many charcters you desire (between 8-128).
- I learned much more about the flow of javascript along with creating variables, functions, and for loops. This also includes what strings are and how to send information back to them if they are empty.

- Click on the 'Generate Password' button then follow the prompts and confirms. You'll be asked to input a number between 8 and 128 and if you would like to include or exclude lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- After everything has been inputted you will then be presented with your new randomized password.
