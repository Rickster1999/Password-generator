# Password Generator

## Description
- I wanted to create the ablity to choose what you wanted in a password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.)and for it to generate a random password at however many charcters you desire (between 8-128).
- I learned much more about the flow of javascript along with creating variables, functions, and for loops. This also includes what strings are and how to send information back to them if they are empty.
